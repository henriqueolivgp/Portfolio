  Hi, I'm Henrique Oliveira, a Software Developer. This is my portfolio where I showcase some of the applications I've developed, either on my own or as part of group projects in an academic setting.
  The projects youâ€™ll find here cover different areas of software development â€” from app design to backend and frontend implementation.
  If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to send me an email through my portfolio or a message on LinkedIn.
  And don't forget to check out the link above and explore the rest of my portfolio!
